## Description

My job was to create an application that records annual salaries and then figure out what the monthly cost for a company would be. 

I started by adding a index.html with setup, client.js & linked it and the style.css & linked it. 

Then, in HTML, I added the 5 input charcters and a submit button. Next, I created a table that would hold the inputs on the click of the submit button. 

Then, in js, I set all the variables for the inputs. I create a handleSubmit function that appended to the DOM all the values of the variables for each input. Then I appended to the employee table so that the input and table were connected.

Next I went back to HTML to add a div for the monthly costs to be shown and add the variable information to it. Then, in js, I redifined the variable monthly costs within the function to be the annual salary divided by 12. I worked in CSS for awhile and then came back and added the remove row function to js.

In CSS, I set a font and and background color. In the header I centered the text, added background & font color, padding and font weight. For the h1 text I wanted to make it bolder so I added a font weight of 1000. In the content id I set up width and margin. In the emplyees id I set up font, border and width for the table. In the employees info id for the tables body I set up a border size and color, and width. For the employees table head I set up the padding, aligned the text to the left, added a background and font color. For the input data I set it up to align with the rest of the table settings. I also, added color to the button and a font weight of 700 and aligned it with the rest of the information on the page. Lastly, for the div that holds the input, button, table and monthly cost I added a border radius, background color and padding so the information could pop on the page.
