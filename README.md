## Description

My job was to create an application that records annual salaries and then figure out what the monthly cost for a company would be. 

First I added the 5 input charcters and a submit button in HTML. Next, I created a table that would hold the inputs on the click of the submit button. Then I create a handleSubmit function in client.js that appended to the DOM all the values of the variables for each input.
